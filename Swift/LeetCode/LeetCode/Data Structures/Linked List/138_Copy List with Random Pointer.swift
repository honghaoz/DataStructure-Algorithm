// Description:
// A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
//
//Return a deep copy of the list.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//
//
//Input:
//{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}
//
//Explanation:
//Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
//Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
//
//
//Note:
//
//You must return the copy of the given head as a reference to the cloned list.
